Ven&#252; is an iOS app developed for the [AT&T Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/att-hackathon-hawaii-tickets-31100289804) that occurred in March 2017 in Honolulu, Hawaii. It was conceptualized, designed, and coded over a 24-hour period by myself and four other students from UH Manoa.

The premise of the idea was an app for event venues to provide information for attendees, such as locations for bathrooms, emergency exit routes, schedules, or general announcements. An organizer would submit information through a website, and attendees could access the event information by scanning a QR code or with a [BLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) connection.

The app was developed for iOS using Xcode, and the backend was implemented through [Amazon Web Services' DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).
