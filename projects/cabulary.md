Cabulary is an Android app that provides simple, categorized lists of words and phrases in various languages. It began as practice for learning [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and the Android environment, as well as for my personal use during my travels around Europe in June 2017. Development began in May 2017, and is currently ongoing.

APK coming soon!
