CorpusTagger is an application I developed in C# using [Stanford's Natural Language Processing software](http://nlp.stanford.edu/). It uses corpus data from the [International Corpus Network of Asian Learners of English](http://language.sakura.ne.jp/icnale/) to analyze lexical diversity and lexical density of ESL students in various levels of learning. CorpusTagger additionally utilizes [an API to port the Stanford NLP from Java to C# by Sergey Tihon](https://sergey-tihon.github.io/Stanford.NLP.NET/StanfordCoreNLP.html)

This project was done mainly on my own, with some guidance about the methodology by my Second Language Acquisition professor. It was very challenging and consequently, very constructive for me as a developer. On the technical side, it was my first full project in any scripting language, and my first full project with a functional UI. I had to figure out the API for the NLP, many of the packages in .NET for data importing, management and visualization, as well as C# itself.
